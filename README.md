# ICRA2020-CMTS
The pytorch code for ICRA2020 paper 'CMTS: Conditional Multiple Trajectory Synthesizer for Generating Safety-critical Driving Scenarios'

## Environment
Python 3.7 <br/>
Pytorch 1.0

## Dataset
The processed Argoverse dataset can be downloaded with this [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ubsosU7TD_Q91vswEfASKGrcrV1htkyt). After downloading the data files (two for trajectories, two for maps), you need to put them into the *data* folder.

## Visualization
Some tools for visualization are provided in *tool* folder. This tools will read the files from *sample* folder, which are saved during the training or generate stage.
